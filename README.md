# Puerto Rico's Municipal Elections, 1976-2020

This respository includes several CSV files on with the results of Puerto Rico's municipal elections. 

Most of the data was collected from Puerto Rico's [Comisi√≥n Estatal de Elecciones](https://www.ceepur.org). I also used data from Manuel Alvarez Rivera's website - [Elecciones in Puerto Rico](https://electionspuertorico.org/home_es.html) to ascertain the gender of the winning mayors.

Here is a list of the CSV files with a short description found in this repository.
