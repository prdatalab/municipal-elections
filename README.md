# Puerto Rico's Municipal Elections, 1976-2020

This respository includes several CSV files on with the results of Puerto Rico's municipal elections. 

Most of the data was collected from Puerto Rico's [Comisi√≥n Estatal de Elecciones](https://www.ceepur.org). I also used data from Manuel Alvarez Rivera's website - [Elecciones in Puerto Rico](https://electionspuertorico.org/home_es.html) to ascertain the gender of the winning mayors.

Here is a list of the CSV files with a short description found in this repository.

| File Name | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| tidy_municipalities_elections_pr_data.csv | This CSV includes the results of Puerto Rico's municipal elections for mayors from 1976 to 2020. There are missing data from 1976 to 1988. From 1992 to 2020, the dataset includes the name of the winning candidate and the gender of the candidate. It includes vote tallies for major and fringe political parties as well as votes for independent and writing-in candidates.|
| municipal_elec_pr_mayors_party_year.csv| This CSV includes the winning party for municipal elections for Puerto Rico's 78 mayors from 1976-2020.|
|elec_mayors_pr_index_1976_2020.csv| This CSV is part of a project indexing the influence of Puerto Rico's main political parties at the municipal level. If the PNP candidate won the mayoral election, the win is represented as a 1. If the PPD candidate won the race, the victory is presented as -1. Thus, overtime we can calculate whether a municipality has been more closely aligned with the PNP or PPD. Thus, scores closer to 1 means that the municipality has aligned the PNP, while scores closer to -1 show that the municipality is aligned with the PPD.|
